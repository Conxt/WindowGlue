3. Drag any window near another window
4. Watch for the glow indicator showing snap positions
5. The dragged window will snap to the terget window

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Accessibility permissions (granted on first launch)

## Privacy

Window Glue requires Accessibility permissions to monitor and manage window positions. No data is collected or transmitted. All processing happens locally on your device.

## Known Issues

1. When dragging a glued window, there is a bit of a lag for the paired window to catch up.
2. When a glued window is dragged to another screen and/or space, the paired window doesn't (yet) follow automatically. When you drag the second window to the new screen/space manually, they will stick together again.
