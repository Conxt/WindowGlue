# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Window Glue is committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

## Information We Collect

### Local Data Only
Window Glue operates entirely on your local machine and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.

### Accessibility Permissions
Window Glue requires Accessibility permissions to:
- Monitor window positions and movements
- Move and resize windows as directed
- Detect window creation and destruction events
- Respond to user gestures and keyboard shortcuts

This permission is granted through macOS System Preferences and can be revoked at any time.

### Local Settings
The app stores minimal settings locally on your device:
- User preferences (shake to unglue, launch at startup)
- Keyboard shortcut configurations
- Onboarding completion status
- Snap tolerance settings

This data is stored using macOS UserDefaults and never leaves your device.

## How We Use Information

All information is used solely to provide the app's functionality:
- Window positions are monitored to enable snapping behavior
- Settings are stored to remember your preferences
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry is collected

## Data Sharing

Window Glue does not share any data with third parties. No information is transmitted over the internet.

## Data Retention

- Settings are retained until you uninstall the app or manually reset them
- Window monitoring happens in real-time and is not stored
- Removing the app deletes all locally stored data

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:
- Disable Accessibility permissions in System Preferences to stop window monitoring
- Uninstall the app to remove all stored data

## Security

- App notarized by Apple
- All data remains on your local device
- No network connections are made
- Standard macOS security protections apply

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Conxt/WindowGlue/issues).

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy as needed. Changes will be reflected in the app's repository and release notes.
